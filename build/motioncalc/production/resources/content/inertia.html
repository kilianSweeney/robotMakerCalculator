<p>There, now you know the inertia values of a cylinder roughly Barack Obama's weight and height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is at the bottom of the inertia calculator screen. It updates each time you change a value. It can also be found by tapping on the "result" button. That will take you to the Solution page where you can copy and paste the solution or share it with other apps and people using the "share" button.</p>
<h2>Integration with the Material Densities list</h2>
<p>If you are calculating for mass (i.e. you've selected to enter the density value), you can select the density value of many known materials by tapping on the "materials" button and selecting a material from the list. You can add your own materials to this list. Read <a href="javascript:Ext.getCmp('aboutItems').setValue('aboutMaterials');" title="Managing Materials">Managing Materials</a> for more info.</p>
<h2>Integration with the units converter</h2>
<p>All the dimension fields use the same "linear distance" unit type. This can be a calculation obstacle if, let's say, you know the length in feet but the width in inches. You can jump over to the units calculator and enter your length there in feet, then use the "+ inertia" button to move the value over to the length field on the inertia calculator.</p>
<h2>Integration with the global settings</h2>
<p>All your solutions are governed by the global settings where you can select your decimal style (US vs Eur) and significant digits (e.g. original number = 6.166667, sig dig = 1 then number = 6, sig dig = 2 then number = 6.2 sig dig = 7 number = 6.16667).</p>
<p>The unit type settings are where you set the unit types for the fields on the inertia calculator. All of the dimension fields (radius, length, height, etc...) use the "linear distance" global setting. You can use the units converter to push values for non-default "linear distance" unit types.
